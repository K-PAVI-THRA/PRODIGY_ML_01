# PRODIGY_ML_01

I have developed a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The objective was to determine the optimal regression line that best estimates house prices (dependent variable) using these independent variables.

# **Dataset**

Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

Steps for Using the Dataset

1.Download all the four files from the website

2.Upload them to your drive in a folder called Datasets to make things easier.

3.Then open Google Collab

4.Add a Code cell above the given code in the ipynb file to mount your Google drive.

# **Code Execution:**

The code is inside the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb file. Do the above steps and execute the code. The train data csv file is used here.

# **Knowledge Gained**

1.Efficient Data Loading and Usage: I learned the importance of focusing on the correct dataset (train.csv) to ensure that the features and target variables used for training and evaluation are accurate. I also gained insights into the challenges of handling multiple data sources and the importance of selecting the appropriate dataset for analysis.

2.Feature Engineering: I applied skills in selecting relevant features, such as LotArea, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, and TotRmsAbvGrd, that have predictive power for house prices. This process helped me understand the importance of preparing and preprocessing data to make it suitable for machine learning models.

3.Linear Regression Implementation: I implemented a linear regression model using scikit-learn, learning how to fit the model to the training data and make predictions. I also evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess prediction accuracy and the overall fit of the model.

4.Data Visualization and Interpretation: I developed the ability to create scatter plots that visualize the relationship between actual and predicted house prices. By including a reference line, I could better interpret the model’s performance and compare it to the ideal prediction scenario.

5.Model Evaluation and Improvement: I gained experience in analyzing model performance and understanding the impact of various evaluation metrics on model quality. I used visualizations to assess how well the model predicts house prices and identify potential areas for improvement.

This task provided valuable hands-on experience with key machine learning concepts, such as data handling, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization, all of which are essential for developing and assessing predictive models.
